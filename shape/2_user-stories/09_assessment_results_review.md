# User Story: Assessment Results Review

**As a** LaunchPad Lab administrator  
**I want** to review completed assessment transcripts  
**So that** I can analyze client AI readiness and provide tailored recommendations

## Context
Administrators need easy access to conversation transcripts to understand client needs and prepare assessment reports.

## Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Admin views company dashboard showing completed assessments
2. Admin clicks on a specific stakeholder's completed assessment from either:
   - Company detail page "View" links
   - Main dashboard "Recent Assessment Activity" feed 
3. Admin views the complete conversation transcript

### Edge Cases
- Very long transcripts: Implement scrolling for basic viewing
- Incomplete assessments: Show partial transcripts with status indicator
- Missing assessment: Show message if stakeholder hasn't completed assessment yet

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] List view of all completed assessments per company
- [x] Clickable assessment links in main dashboard Recent Activity feed
- [x] Full transcript display with timestamps
- [x] Assessment metadata (duration, completion date, stakeholder info)
- [x] Consistent access from multiple entry points (company view + dashboard)

## Key Screens
- Main admin dashboard with clickable Recent Activity feed
- Company assessment results dashboard
- Individual transcript viewer

## MVP Decisions
- **Search functionality**: Not implemented for MVP - basic scrolling sufficient
- **Admin notes/comments**: Not needed for MVP
- **Export functionality**: Not needed for MVP - admins can copy/paste if needed
- **Advanced analytics**: Not needed for MVP
- **AI-powered summarization**: Not needed for MVP
