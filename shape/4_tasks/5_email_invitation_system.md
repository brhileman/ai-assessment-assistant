  domain: 'launchpadlab.com',

  enable_starttls_auto: true
}
```

## Success Criteria

## Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: UUID tokens are cryptographically secure and unique
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam by limiting invitation frequency
- **Email Validation**: Validate email addresses before sending
- **Unsubscribe**: Include unsubscribe links where required
- **Data Privacy**: Only include necessary information in emails

## Next Steps

After Task 5 completion:
- Task 6: Create stakeholder landing pages for assessment entry
- Task 7: Implement the voice assessment interface
- Email system enables stakeholder engagement and communication flow
