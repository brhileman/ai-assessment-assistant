# AI Assessment Assistant - Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a Rails 8 application for conducting AI readiness assessments through voice-powered conversations with stakeholders. The project is built by LaunchPad Lab.

## Production Environment
- **IMPORTANT: This application is deployed to production on Heroku**
- **Production URL**: https://ai-assessment-assistant-9e4a484c0b2f.herokuapp.com/
- **Heroku App Name**: ai-assessment-assistant
- **Deployment Command**: `git push heroku main`

## Project Structure
- The Rails application is located in `code/ai_assessment_assistant/` (nested structure)
- Product documentation is in `shape/` directory
- Wrapper scripts in `bin/` automatically handle the nested structure

## Key Technologies
- Rails 8.0.2 with PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- OpenAI Realtime API for voice conversations
- SendGrid for email delivery
- Devise passwordless for admin authentication
- RSpec for testing

## Development Workflow
1. Always create a new branch before making changes
2. Follow the Nova workflow rules (see shape/ directory)
3. Use the wrapper scripts in bin/ instead of cd'ing to the Rails directory
4. Deploy to Heroku from the main branch only
